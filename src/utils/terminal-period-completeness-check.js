// terminal-period-completeness-check.js — G2 (Phase D deterministic
// gap-fill). Sourced from "Issues the Audit Missed": terminal periods
// omitting merchandise costs, working-capital movements, and sustaining
// capex — a real, real-world-confirmed failure mode.
//
// ARCHITECTURALLY DISTINCT from L10 (formula-pattern-consistency-check.js):
// L10 catches a formula whose STRUCTURE differs from its row's dominant
// pattern. This catches something L10 cannot: a formula that is
// structurally IDENTICAL across the whole row (so L10 sees nothing wrong
// at all) but resolves to an unexpected zero in the terminal period(s)
// specifically, because an upstream driver silently dropped out. This is
// a VALUE-based anomaly check, not a formula-text check.
//
// KEY DESIGN CHALLENGE, addressed directly: a genuine business wind-down
// (declining terminal-period values) is normal, not a defect — this must
// not be confused with a genuine data/formula gap. The distinguishing
// signal used here: the drop must be SUDDEN, specifically at the
// terminal boundary — the "established" window immediately before the
// terminal period(s) must itself be relatively stable (not already
// trending toward zero), which a legitimate gradual wind-down would
// violate (its established window would ALSO be declining), but a
// genuine omission would not (the established window looks normal right
// up until the cliff).

// development cost aggregate ("TOTAL USES", "TOTAL SOURCES", "BG cost

// because a driver silently dropped out. This looks IDENTICAL to a

// as a construction-cost rollup. Excluding these specific labels is a
// narrow, targeted fix for a real, recurring pattern on any finite-
